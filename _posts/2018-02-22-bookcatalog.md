title: Book Catalog

Book Catalog is an Android app which I built for my Udacity's Android Networking course. The app consists of multiple Activities which allows users to search for books and get detailed information about them.

The main purpose of this app is to demonstrate the ability to read from a REST API and display the data in a user-friendly manner. This is achieved by having the main Activity display a search bar and a list of matching books found through the Google Books API. Clicking an item from the list will start a new Activity which contains details of the book selected.
