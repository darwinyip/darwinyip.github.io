(*post-apocalytic narration voice*) In a world riddled with more JavaScript frameworks than atoms in the universe, comes a lone soul's futile mission of building web*apps* using nothing but pure JavaScript (no, not referring to pure.js).

Introducing **Todo List**: the most basic application after **Hello World** that any web developer will build.

Featuring:
- Create tasks
- Delete tasks
- Modify tasks
- Save your list
- Load your list

And no need to worry about security because everything sits right in your browser (just make sure you are not typing anything important, because all will be gone once you clear cache).
