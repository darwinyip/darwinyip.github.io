Quizoology is an Android app which I built for my final project for Udacity's Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics. The app consists of a single Activity which quizzes the user in animal facts.

(Yes, the intro is more or less a copy and paste of my previous post)

Moving along, the goal of this project is to create an app from concept to final product. In here I utilize everything I have learned plus a sprinkle of my own creativity to make the most exciting quiz app about animals currently in the market.
