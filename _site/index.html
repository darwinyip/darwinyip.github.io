      <p>Through my years working in tech, I have encountered legacy projects that have gone unmantained; usually because the system still runs but the original developers are no longer around and there is no one to pick it up. From time to time, these will require some fixes (maybe an unexpected new input) or enhancements (the data layout has expanded and there is now a use case to include it). Sadly, the previous developers left no traces of documentations or meaningful comments, and now it fall on the new developer (me) to figure things out. Surely one can go about reverse engineering the logic of the program; however no amount of digging through the code will tell what was the business context behind certain decisions. At that point, the best approach is to consult the business analysts, project managers, and others more directly exposed to the business as they would have better insight of the possible use cases that have prompted certain design decisions.</p>

      <p>A while back I decided to learn ReactJS. A friend lent me his Udemy account and I worked through the lessons and did the course projects. After finishing the course, I wanted to try working on my own project without the hand-holding of an instructor. For that, I decided to do something with Open Data, which is data published by government entities.</p>

      <p>(<em>post-apocalytic narration voice</em>) In a world riddled with more JavaScript frameworks than atoms in the universe, comes a lone soul’s futile mission of building web<em>apps</em> using nothing but pure JavaScript (no, not referring to pure.js).</p>

      <p>Pill has been my first successful attempt at developing a game. The mechanics of it are simplistic, if not brain dead. The objective of this game is to control the “character” and eat all the pills which appear randomly throughout the screen.</p>
