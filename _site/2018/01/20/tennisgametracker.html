	<p>Tennis Game Tracker is an Android app which I built for my first project for Udacityâ€™s Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics. The app consists of a single Activity which tracks the course of a tennis game-set-match.</p>

<p>In this app, I am demonstrating my ability to create a complex layout with uniform look and custom color scheme, as well as modify Views via Java.</p>

<p>The code currently lacks proper structuring which makes tracking logic and View update logic to be tightly coupled. In future revisions, I plan to separate the logic and clean up the code to be more modular. Also, not all the tennis rules were implemented, such as deuces or professional sets. However, for the most part the tracker is usable for a casual game.</p>

<p>I learned a lot making Tennis Game Tracker and definitely made me understand my limitations in knowledge and experience. It was a fun experience building this and will continue on improving it.</p>
