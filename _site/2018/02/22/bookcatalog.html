	<p>Book Catalog is an Android app which I built for my Udacityâ€™s Android Networking course. The app consists of multiple Activities which allows users to search for books and get detailed information about them.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this app is to demonstrate the ability to read from a REST API and display the data in a user-friendly manner. This is achieved by having the main Activity display a search bar and a list of matching books found through the Google Books API. Clicking an item from the list will start a new Activity which contains details of the book selected.</p>
